# Receiver directory changelog

## Unreleased

- Add the receiver directory: authenticated zero-OVK receiver extraction,
  paginated fixed-width records, deterministic publications from 8192 to 65536
  rows that retry up to 16 salts before doubling, `IWFLT1` files of labeled BIP 158
  receiver sets (paid receivers, plus each swap provider's recent and seen sets as
  the manifest declares them, with when its feed started and last completed a read;
  directory profile `ironwood-zero-ovk-receiver-v1`, whose revision hashes every
  field at fixed width and refuses unknown ones), and common `IWPROOF1` witness
  files, built from histories of at most 2^22 commitments.
