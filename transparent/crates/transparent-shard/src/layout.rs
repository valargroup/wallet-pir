//! Named, pinned table geometries with a shared compact row codec.
//!
//! Uniformity is the whole point. The native ReinspiRING profile's public query
//! setup is a pure function of the geometry and table, so shards that share a
//! geometry share one set of scheme parameters — a client validates parameters and derives its
//! query setup once for every shard it will ever query, instead of once per
//! shard. The registry fixes each geometry; sealing bounds ordinary shard
//! demand and adds segments for an indivisible oversized block.
//!
//! Both tables use the scheme's single-instance width, 4,096 bytes: one
//! 2,048-coefficient polynomial of 16-bit plaintexts. The
//! directory carries two inline events per entry; the page row is sized for
//! storage rather than for the query count of the longest history, which is
//! what [`PAGE_ROW_BYTES`] explains.
//!
//! # Segments
//!
//! Row *counts* are pinned per segment, not per shard. A shard normally has one
//! segment of each table and nothing below is visible; a shard whose content
//! does not fit one segment gets another of the same geometry, so the parameter
//! set stays shared. A shard's logical row space is its segments concatenated,
//! and a row index is taken over that whole space — which is why placement
//! stays even instead of spilling into a last segment, and why a page extent
//! that crosses a segment is ordinary addressing.

///
/// Neither dimension is free. The native profile requires a row count that is a
/// multiple of `POLY_LEN` = 2,048 and refuses fewer, and it quantises the row
/// width into instances of 2,048 x 16 bits = 4,096 bytes. So the smallest legal
/// table is 2,048 rows of 4,096 bytes. Script capacity depends on encoded
/// directory-entry bytes as well as two-choice placement. [`Geometry::validate`] is where that is enforced, so a
/// sweep cannot quietly score a shape the scheme would never serve.
///
/// The two dimensions do not cost the same. Row count is charged on the query
/// upload alone, and mildly: 2,048 rows cost 40,200 bytes a query and 4,096
/// cost 52,744, +31.2%. Row width is charged on the response *and* the
/// published setup, and in whole instances, so the next legal width doubles
/// both. Widening to buy directory slots is therefore the expensive way to buy
/// them and doubling the row count is the cheap one.
