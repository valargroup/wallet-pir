//! Deciding where one shard ends and the next begins.
//!
//! Shards are sealed on what they *contain*, not on how many blocks they span.
//! Nothing bounds what a height range holds — transparent density on mainnet
//! varies several-fold across the chain, and a spam burst varies it further —
//! so a fixed-width shard would either waste most of a pinned table on a quiet
//! range or overflow it on a busy one. Sealing on content makes that variation
//! a difference in block span instead, which costs nothing.
//!
//! # Why three thresholds and not one
//!
//! Distinct script count bounds the filter, actual compact directory bytes
//! bound directory storage, and packed page rows bound page storage. Each
//! block's projection applies the same per-history encoding and packing rule
//! as the builder. Variable packing is not monotone: a later event can change
//! inline compression or the mix of shared entries. Decisions use the exact
//! projected state; they never assume that a history which does not fit now
//! cannot fit later.
//!
//! Distinct transaction ids are counted and reported but do not seal:
//! they size the optional transaction-detail table, which this POC does not
//! build. Over the Ironwood-to-tip journal that limit never bound in any
//! candidate policy, so dropping it moves no boundary.
//!
//! # Why capacity and target are separate numbers
//!
//! A threshold alone is not enough. Blocks arrive whole, and one block can add
//! thousands of scripts, so a shard that was just under a threshold could land
//! far past it — past what the pinned geometry actually holds. So each quantity
//! has two numbers: the `capacity` the tables really hold, and the `target` at
//! which sealing is preferred. A block that would breach capacity seals the
//! shard *before* it is added; reaching a target seals *after*. Targets should
//! sit below capacity by at least the largest block worth accommodating.
//!
//! # The block that fits nowhere
//!
//! Sealing cannot help a block whose own content exceeds a capacity: there is
//! nothing to seal before it. Refusing to publish it would let one purchased
//! block halt the service, so such a block is absorbed into a shard of its own,
//! and the builder gives that shard as many segments of the pinned geometry as
//! its content needs. The seal thresholds are per segment, so this changes
//! nothing for ordinary shards — the block that overran a capacity is above
//! every target too, so the shard closes immediately after it.
