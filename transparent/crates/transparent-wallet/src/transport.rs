//! What a wallet fetches, and what it is charged for.
//!
//! Filters and private queries come from *different* sources by construction.
//! A wallet must not learn to fetch public bytes from the same place it makes
//! private requests, or the two become correlated whatever the protocol says,
//! so the two are separate traits and a caller has to supply both.
//!
//! # Accounting
//!
//! Bytes are counted as delivered — envelope and framing included, and
//! including bytes paid for on an attempt that later failed. A measurement that
//! counted only payloads would understate what a wallet actually pays, which is
//! the number the whole design has to beat.
//!
//! Stages are kept apart because they answer different questions. Filter bytes
//! are paid by *every* wallet unconditionally and are the floor. Setup is paid
//! once per shard a wallet opens. Query bytes scale with matches. Collapsing
//! them into one total would hide which part is actually expensive.
//!
//! Private bytes are split by *table* for the same reason. The directory is
//! what a script costs to find and the pages are what its history costs to
//! read, and geometry moves cost between them rather than removing it: wider
//! shards mean fewer directory lookups, but a script's two inline events are
//! granted per shard, so the same history spread over fewer shards keeps fewer
//! of them inline and pays a page query instead. A single private total cannot
//! show that transfer, and a geometry cannot be chosen without seeing it.
