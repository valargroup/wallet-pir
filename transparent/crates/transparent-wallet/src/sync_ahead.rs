//! Cross-shard request concurrency: the requests of a pass, sent together.
//!
//! The sequential walk reads one shard at a time: its filter, its manifest, its
//! directory setup, its directory queries, its pages. Each request waits for
//! the one before, so a restore spanning several matched shards pays one round
//! trip per request. Most of those requests do not depend on each other. Once
//! every uncached filter is local, which shards match and which scripts matched
//! them is known before any private request, and so are the manifests and
//! directory setups the walk will ask for. Once the manifests are verified, so
//! are the directory rows.
//!
//! [`look_ahead`] computes exactly those requests, hands them to the transport
//! as two batches, and stashes the outcome of every one that was sent where the
//! walk will look for it: manifests and setups in [`Staged`], filters in
//! [`StagedFilters`], queries in each directory
//! [`TableClient`](crate::client::TableClient) with the secret that decodes
//! them. The walk then runs unchanged. A stashed outcome is consumed at most
//! once, at the point where the sequential walk would have made that request,
//! and a refusal or failure is handled there exactly as if the request had just
//! been made: a withdrawn revision refreshes the map, an overload backs off and
//! retries within the same attempt budget, anything else fails the sync with
//! the store as the sequential walk would have left it. An unsent request is
//! made by the walk in its place. The walk is still what verifies, commits,
//! retries and refreshes, so its semantics are the sequential walk's.
//!
//! # What stays the same
//!
//! - Which requests are made, per shard and per table: the lookahead derives
//!   them from the same filter bytes, script lists, choice table and setup
//!   cache the walk would use, and the walk consumes rather than repeats them.
//!   No query is skipped because another response mentioned a script.
//! - Charges: a stashed reply is charged when the walk consumes it, with what
//!   the transport reported, so totals equal the sequential walk's.
//! - Commits: still per shard, in shard order, by the walk.
//!
//! # What changes
//!
//! When requests are sent. The service sees a pass's manifests and setups
//! together, then its directory queries together, instead of interleaved with
//! commits. Page work is not batched: which pages a script needs is known only
//! after its directory entry decodes.
//!
//! Requests the walk ends up not using are extra on the wire. If the walk stops
//! or restarts before a shard it looked ahead to — an exhausted overload
//! budget, a withdrawn revision and the refresh after it, a hard error — the
//! requests already sent for later shards were seen by the service and never
//! used. Those shards matched, so the next sync asks the same of them; a
//! refresh re-walks the rest of the pass in sequence. Likewise, requests
//! already in flight when a batch meets its first failure complete, and those
//! for the same shard after a refused query go unused, because the walk
//! retries that shard from its first query.
//!
//! The lookahead stops at the first shard whose endpoint, filter or manifest
//! does not check out, which is where the walk would stop too. A budgeted sync
//! never looks ahead, because whether a later shard's queries are sent at all
//! depends on page work only the walk discovers.
