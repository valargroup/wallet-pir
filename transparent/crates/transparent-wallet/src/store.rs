//! What a wallet keeps between syncs, and the one boundary it changes at.
//!
//! A sync that starts from nothing every time cannot be a returning wallet: it
//! forgets the receive it found last month, so the spend it finds today is
//! unresolved, and moving the birthday forward to save work throws the receive
//! away for good. The store is the wallet's memory of what it has recovered,
//! which scripts it is responsible for and over which ranges each is covered,
//! what it accepted as the chain's anchor, and what private work it still owes.
//!
//! # One commit per shard
//!
//! Everything a shard yields is committed together — its events, the coverage
//! it establishes for each script, and the page work still owed — or not at
//! all. A crash between two commits loses at most one shard's retrieval, which
//! the next sync repeats; it never records coverage for events it did not keep
//! or events under coverage it did not record. Retrying a commit is idempotent
//! by construction: events are keyed by their stable identities, coverage by
//! script and range, and a repeat that *differs* in any field is a
//! contradiction, refused rather than merged.
//!
//! # Provisional and settled
//!
//! Coverage taken from an unsealed tail carries that revision's digest. When
//! the tail is superseded, that coverage and the events under it are truncated
//! and the range re-derived; when the same digest is later sealed, it is
//! promoted in place. Settled coverage is never rewritten except by a reorg,
//! which rolls everything above the accepted ancestor back at once.
//!
//! # What the wallet owns
//!
//! This is a trait so the wallet that embeds the library supplies the storage:
//! its own database, its own transaction, its own encryption. The reference
//! implementations — in memory here, SQLite in `transparent-wallet-store` —
//! are what the tests run against and what a first integration can use as-is.
