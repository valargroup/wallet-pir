//! Wallet client for the tiered txid display publication
//! (`/v1/txid/`, see `transparent/docs/txid-display.md`).
//!
//! The client is synchronous and has no HTTP stack: the wallet supplies a
//! [`TxidTransport`] that sends one [`TxidRequest`] and returns the raw
//! [`TxidReply`]. The client interprets every status code itself, validates
//! everything the server publishes against its own derivation, and caches
//! native profiles, the init document, the map, manifests and setups.
//!
//! A lookup sends, in order and one at a time: init, the recent map, the
//! archive index chunk covering the height (archive heights only), the
//! shard's manifest and the bucket's directory setups when they are not
//! cached, then exactly two directory queries (even when both candidate rows
//! coincide). Entries are fixed-size, so a found txid and an absent one send
//! the same requests with the same body sizes. Each query carries a 44-bit
//! dithered selection when init advertises the dithered scheme and it
//! reproduces locally, and the 49-bit one every service accepts otherwise;
//! either way every query of one client has the same size. Placement comes from the
//! caller's mined height; nothing
//! is asked to discover it, so placement and support results send no query.
//!
//! The map is split (see `transparent_shard::display::split`): a small
//! recent map, refetched after every 409, and immutable index chunks of 32
//! archives, cached by digest. The full `/v1/txid/shards` listing is not read.
//!
//! The client follows a fresh publication (a re-cut or re-layout, with new
//! shard ids and digests) through the same map: a 409 or a placement from a
//! stale map fetches it again, a geometry init lacks fetches init and the map
//! again, and each new map keeps only the manifests and setups of revisions
//! it names. A map of another chain (network or genesis hash) is refused.
//! A lookup sends at most 2 map, 3 init and 4 query requests.
//!
//! Any validation failure is [`TxidError::Protocol`], never
//! [`TxidLookup::Absent`].
