/// metadata a server could misreport.
///
/// `P` and `M` are unchanged. In BIP 158 an element is mapped into `[0, N*M)`,
/// so the per-tested-element false-positive rate is `1/M` regardless of how
/// many elements the filter holds: a shard filter over twelve thousand scripts
/// is exactly as precise per query as a block filter over twelve. What grows
/// with the element count is the filter's *size*, which is what deduplicating
/// scripts across a shard's blocks is meant to pay for.
