//! BIP 158 transparent activity filters for Zcash.
//!
//! This crate implements the `zcash-transparent-basic-v1` application profile:
//! one deterministic filter per accepted block, covering the transparent
//! scripts a block creates and spends, so a wallet can test its own scripts
//! locally without revealing them.
//!
//! What it does not do: it does not prove a filter is complete. Matching a
//! filter against the wallet's accepted block hash binds where the filter
//! claims to be, not what it claims to contain. Advancing coverage on a
//! negative result is only sound if the filter's author is trusted to have
//! built it over the whole block.
