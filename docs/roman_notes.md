## Enhance PIR Value Structure

- ephemeralKey — note key agreement.
- encCiphertext — note and authenticated memo.
- cv_net and outCiphertext — OVK-based outgoing recovery.

### encCiphertext

encCiphertext is 580 bytes total:
```
Encrypted plaintext:
  0..1       version                 1 byte (0x03 for Ironwood)
  1..12      diversifier           11 bytes
  12..20     value                  8 bytes
  20..52     rseed                 32 bytes
  52..564    memo                 512 bytes

Authentication:
  564..580   Poly1305 tag           16 bytes
                                      ─────
                                      580 bytes
```

The first 52 encrypted bytes contain everything necessary to discover and reconstruct the note:
```
version + diversifier + value + rseed = 52 bytes
```

Given ephemeralKey and an IVK, the wallet derives the note-encryption key and decrypts that prefix. It then validates the candidate using cmx and the derived ephemeral key.

Compact scanning does not need the memo so it is ommitted for bandwidth purposes.

### ourCiphertext

outCiphertext is separate:
```
Encrypted outgoing plaintext:
  pk_d                  32 bytes
  esk                   32 bytes
Authentication tag      16 bytes
                        ─────
                         80 bytes
```

So the encrypted-output material is:
```
ephemeralKey[32]
encCiphertext[580]
outCiphertext[80]
transparentShapeFlags[1]
```

`cv_net`, `cmx`, and the OVK derive the key that opens `outCiphertext`. Its recovered pk_d + esk then derive the key that opens encCiphertext.

## Incoming Decryption

```
ivk + ephemeralKey
        ↓ Diffie–Hellman
shared secret
        ↓ KDF
note encryption key
        ↓
decrypt encCiphertext
        ↓
note + value + recipient + memo
```

Compact blocks provide only the first 52 bytes of `encCiphertext`. That discovers the note, but the remaining 528 bytes are needed for the memo and authentication tag.

## Outgoing Recovery

The sender cannot use an IVK to decrypt outputs sent to someone else. Instead it uses its outgoing viewing key (ovk):
```
ovk + cv_net + cmx + ephemeralKey
                ↓
       outgoing cipher key (ock)
                ↓
       decrypt outCiphertext
                ↓
       recipient pk_d + ephemeral secret esk
                ↓
       esk + pk_d → shared secret
                ↓
       decrypt encCiphertext
                ↓
       recipient + value + memo
```

## PIR Layout

Key: action's output note's index in the commitment tree
Value (725 bytes):
```
Offset   Size   Field
0        32     ephemeralKey
32       580    encCiphertext
612      32     cv_net
644      80     outCiphertext
                ───
                725 bytes
```

With nine records per row:
```
9 × 725 = 6,525-byte PIR row
row  = position / 9
slot = position % 9
```

Incoming recovery uses `ephemeralKey` + `encCiphertext`. Outgoing recovery additionally uses `cv_net` + `outCiphertext`, with `cmx` supplied by the compact action.

Why 9 records per row?
- Two 2048 × 14-bit PIR instances carry 7,168 bytes. Nine records use 6,525 bytes; ten would need 7,250 bytes and a third instance.
- Nine is therefore the densest layout with the same cryptographic instance count and response size as eight.
- At 136,425 positions it uses 15,159 rows, which rounds to 16,384 logical rows. Eight records would use 17,054 rows and round to 32,768.
- The division and remainder by constant nine are negligible compared with the PIR work.

## Scalability

1. One controller and multipler workers where each worker has a separate set of shards
2. Because online evaluation is memory-bandwidth-bound, scale horizontally
across workers with independent memory bandwidth. Each worker owns a
disjoint shard range, and the coordinator evaluates all ranges in parallel
A starting configuration is 4 vCPU / 4 GiB workers, sized to keep no more
than approximately 2 GiB of total resident PIR state, including
preprocessing artifacts and retained frontier generations. Confirm the
worker size and shards-per-worker setting with an end-to-end load test
3. Workers are organized into shard groups with two active-active replicas.
Each query uses one ready replica per group and fails over to its peer; the
replica partials are alternatives and must not both be added.
4. Query size grows as the database grows. For example, at 1 million
positions in Ironwood, we are at 0.79 MB query upload. As a result,
we could have a coordinator-workers topology for the most recent 1M
and split the older per 10M. Anonymity set is still large and is a strict improvement over today.

## Wallets

### Wallet Cases

A. Ironwood-only receive

Today: enhance tx by id

Changing to: Enhance PIR by output note commitment tree index.

B. Wallet-funded Ironwood send

Changing to: One Enhance PIR query per non-change action by output note commitment tree index.

Result: Recover sent outputs using candidate OVKs

C. Mixed transparent + Ironwood

Today: enhance tx by id. Find Transparent outputs and match against wallet's address.

Possible solution: PIR by tx ID for transparent outputs

D. Transparent-only receive

Today: `derived addresses` → `GetAddressUtxos`
- The server returns currently unspent outputs. This discovers funds, but reveals the queried transparent addresses to the server.

E. Spend of a known transparent UTXO

Today: known outpoint → spender lookup
- Legacy mode queries transactions involving the address.

Possible solution: The new transparent-spend PIR instead queries the outpoint privately and records spent or unspent status through tip.

### Architecture Possibilities

#### Shielded Only Case

For Ironwood-only transactions and mixed Ironwood + Transparent, use Ironwood Enhance PIR.

For mixed Ironwood + Other Pools, fallback to today's LWD enhacement. The case should
be rare enough for it to not matter.

#### Handling Transparent

1. **vin/vout in Compact Block**

vin/vout in Compact Block is the approach upstream is pursuing.

In this approach, the compact block data returns all data necessary for
transparent management in the wallet.

There is no need to do external public queries anymore because we can deconstruct
and attribute wallet's full transparent ledger during sync.

The downside is that every block pays additional transparent sync bandwidth.

If someone does many transparent sends or spams, every wallet pays bandwidth overhead
every block.

2. **Transparent-PIR**

For Transparent PIR, one PIR table is insufficient, and every case must be handled separately.

First, facts:

At height 3,471,419

- Spent: 1,375,697 — 4.68%
- Unspent: 28,033,883 — 95.32%
- Total transparent outputs created: 29,409,580

Around same time, there were 844,457 transparent addresses holding positive balance.

First, it helps to answer: does my wallet own any transparent?

Instead of wasting bandwidth or server compute for having every wallet query the
full PIR database, we could have a light Bloom-filter like PIR table.

Wallet wakes up and efficiently asks privately: "do I own any transparent at current tip?". If the answer is no, I do not need to do any further transparent PIR work.

Reconstructing transparent essentially reduces to:
1. Current balance
2. History

We do this from
* Owned outputs
   * Transaction id and output index
   * Value
   * Locking script/address
   * Creation height and block hash
   * Coinbase or no
* Spends of owned outputs
   * Which owned output was consumed
   * Spending transaction ID.
   * Spend height and block hash

From these events:

```
current UTXOs: owned outputs - spent owned outputs

balance = sum(spendable current UTXOs)
```

What is a practical shard for a filter?
