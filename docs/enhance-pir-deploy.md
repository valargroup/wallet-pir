# Enhance PIR deployment

Scope: Enhance PIR. For transparent script-history recovery, use the [current transparent PIR index](transparent-pir/README.md); the retained outpoint-keyed transparent-spend protocol is a different component.

The coordinator publishes the Enhance table for one best-chain-tip generation,
on its replicated workers. A tip reorg truncates the journal to the common
ancestor before a replacement generation is published.

The transparent-spend tables are not served and no worker is provisioned for
them; see `docs/architecture.md`.

The production workflow builds and rolls out the Enhance coordinator, workers,
and APM sidecar. Wallet clients were not deployed against the superseded API,
so the server can move directly to Enhance schema 6, protocol
`ironwood-enhance-pir-v1`, plus the `/v1/enhance/*` endpoints.

The manual workflow accepts a full commit SHA that must be the current `main`
revision and must already have a successful CI run. It builds and checksums:

- `enhance-pir-server`
- `enhance-pir-worker`
- `enhance-pir-cli`
- `pir-apm`
- the matching systemd and Caddy configuration

Operational configuration uses the `ENHANCE_` prefix. The deployment helper
expects `ENHANCE_COORDINATOR_HOST`, `ENHANCE_DEPLOY_USER`,
`ENHANCE_PUBLIC_URL`, and `ENHANCE_WORKERS_JSON`; preflight/deploy modes also
require the artifact, SSH, release, and service-file variables validated by the
script.

```sh
ENHANCE_COORDINATOR_HOST=coordinator.example.net \
ENHANCE_DEPLOY_USER=deploy \
ENHANCE_PUBLIC_URL=https://enhance.example.net \
ENHANCE_WORKERS_JSON='[{"name":"shard-group-01","replicas":[{"name":"worker-01a","ssh_host":"worker-01a.example.net","service_url":"http://10.0.0.2:8091"},{"name":"worker-01b","ssh_host":"worker-01b.example.net","service_url":"http://10.0.0.3:8091"}]}]' \
ops/scripts/deploy-enhance-pir.sh validate
```

Each ordered shard group owns six shards and has exactly two active-active
replicas. Group order is append-only because it determines shard placement;
replicas inside an existing group may be replaced without moving shards. A
generation publishes once at least one replica in every used group is ready.
The first rollout from the legacy flat inventory is an intentional topology
format migration and requires `ENHANCE_ALLOW_TOPOLOGY_CHANGE=true`; later
replica replacements do not require that override.
Each Enhance worker service is cgroup-limited to 2 GiB, with swap disabled. A
replica that exceeds the limit is restarted by systemd; its peer continues
serving the group while it rebuilds on the next publication.

Current runtime paths are `/etc/enhance-pir`, `/opt/enhance-pir`,
`/srv/zakura/enhance-data`, and `/srv/enhance-pir/artifacts`. Active
DigitalOcean resources use Enhance names. The attached Zakura data volume is
the sole exception: DigitalOcean cannot rename it in place, so Terraform keeps
its historical provider name and protects it from replacement.

The deploy verifies `GET /v1/health`, retrieves and validates the atomic
`GET /v1/enhance/init` response, and completes a dummy query through the
public origin before declaring the rollout successful. It reads the former
generation endpoint only when capturing rollback metadata from a legacy
deployment.
